### MACHINE LEARNING
## Supervised vs. Unsupervised Learning

Machine learning algorithms can be broadly categorized into two main types: supervised and unsupervised learning.

Supervised Learning: Algorithms that learn from labeled training data, where the input data is associated with the correct output. 
Examples: Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM, KNN (for classification)

Unsupervised Learning: Algorithms that work with unlabeled data, aiming to find hidden patterns, groupings, or structures within the data. Clustering and dimensionality reduction are common tasks in unsupervised learning.
Example: KNN (for density-based clustering)

This repository provides a comprehensive overview of various machine learning algorithms, including Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, Random Forest, 
and Support Vector Machines (SVM). Each algorithm is implemented, explained, and demonstrated using Python and popular machine learning libraries.

Algorithms Covered
# Linear Regression
Linear Regression is a fundamental algorithm used for predictive modeling. It aims to establish a linear relationship between input features and a continuous target variable. 
It's suitable for predicting numerical outcomes and understanding feature relationships.

Example: linear_regression.py

# Logistic Regression
Logistic Regression is commonly used for binary classification tasks. It estimates the probability of a binary outcome using the logistic function. 
It's versatile and can be extended for multi-class classification as well.

Example: logistic_regression.py

# Random Forest
Random Forest is an ensemble learning technique that combines multiple decision trees to improve predictive accuracy and control overfitting.
It's suitable for both classification and regression tasks and is robust to noisy data.

Example: decision_tree & random_forest.py

# Support Vector Machines (SVM)
Support Vector Machines (SVM) are powerful for both classification and regression tasks. They find a hyperplane that best separates or fits data points. 
SVM can handle complex decision boundaries and are effective even in high-dimensional spaces.

Example: Support Vector Machines.py

# K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
K-Nearest Neighbors is a simple yet effective classification algorithm. It classifies a data point by considering the class of its k nearest neighbors. It's a non-parametric algorithm that doesn't assume any specific distribution of data.

Example: k_nearest.py
